## Context and Problem Statement
Avoid complexity in the Stats screen
## Decision Drivers
* Divide the StatsGreen screen into logical building blocks
* Ensure the ability to change system parts without affecting others

## Decision Outcome
We decided to divide the StatsGreen screen into a statistics and header & footer. The header & footer are not considered as a micro-frontend, because they are simple views with minimal services. 
### Consequences
* Good: The header & footer can be used in another screen, promoting reusability. One team can be in charge of
the stats.
* Bad: Good communication for implementation is needed.
