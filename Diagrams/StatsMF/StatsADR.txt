## Context and Problem Statement
Avoid complexity in the Stats screen
## Decision Drivers
* Divide the Stats screen into logical building blocks
* Ensure the ability to change system parts without affecting others

## Decision Outcome
We decided to divide the Stats screen into a statistics and header & footer.
### Consequences
* Good: The header & footer can be used in another screen, promoting reusability. One team can be in charge of
the stats and work separately.
* Bad: Good communication for implementation is needed.


## More Information
* We divided the system in three layers: UI, business logic, and data storage.
