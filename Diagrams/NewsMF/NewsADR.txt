## Context and Problem Statement
Avoid complexity in the Stats screen
## Decision Drivers
 Divide the News screen into logical building blocks
 Ensure the ability to change system parts without affecting others

## Decision Outcome
We decided to divide the News screen into a news and header & footer.
### Consequences
 Good: 
	- The header & footer can be used in another screen, promoting reusability. One team can be in charge of
the news and work separately.
	- Simplicity
 Bad:
	-Good communication for implementation is needed.


## More Information
 We divided the system in three layers UI, business logic, and data storage.
