## Decision Drivers
 Divide the SavedProducts screen into logical building blocks
 Ensure the ability to change system parts without affecting others



## Decision Outcome
We decided to divide the SavedProducts screen into a Saved Products and header & footer.
### Consequences
* Good: The header & footer can be used in another screen, promoting reusability. One team can be in charge of
the saved products and work separately.
* Bad: Good communication for implementation is needed.
