## Decision Drivers
 Divide the SavedProducts screen into logical building blocks
 Ensure the ability to change system parts without affecting others



## Decision Outcome
We decided to divide the SavedProducts screen into a Saved Products and header & footer. The header & footer are not considered as a micro-frontend, because they are simple views with minimal services. 
### Consequences
* Good: The header & footer can be used in another screen, promoting reusability. One team can be in charge of
the saved products.
* Bad: Good communication for implementation is needed.
